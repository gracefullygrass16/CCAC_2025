Figma design: https://www.figma.com/proto/CG45aY1qhkvJfJT9nFZJMF/CCAC-collaboration?node-id=62-46&p=f&t=BZouWbxuFQxt5jdn-0&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1

home page design for scrolling (inspiration): https://era.estate/
1. At the start: text half on background image 
2. Background zooms in to device width but with a margin (like how it is now), text moves up above the background image (and eventually keeps a fixed width with the background image)
3. after background fully expands, background image becomes static and basically scrolls normally with the content


-btw to load the full quiz uncomment the questions in quiz.js cause i commented out most of the questions so debugging is easier
