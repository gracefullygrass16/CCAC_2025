## Needa install flask and matplotlab before hosting
```bash
pip install flask
pip install matplotlib
```


## Host it locally
```bash
python ccac.py
```

hosting it locally cuz we havent figured out vercel(maybe?) ...


## Additional notes
Other than the questions, most of the text/images are currently placeholders (we chatgpt-ed them) until ccac gets back to us on what they wanna write
(esp all the descriptions)

For the frontend: we're currently still working on the results and profile pages
- Results: just needa style it and combine hwina's design
- profile: discuss with ccac abt the logging in with google thing and how much students can customise
- index.html: just the scrolling thing at the top asdfghjkl
  (the inspiration: https://era.estate/)

-btw to load the full quiz uncomment the questions in quiz.js cause i commented out most of the questions so debugging is easier 

For the backend: we're so lost (but thinking MongoDB?)
